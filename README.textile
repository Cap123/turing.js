Every part of the series has been tagged with _lmaf_ on DailyJS: "dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf":http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf.

h3. Running Tests

To run tests, ensure you've got the required submodules from git:

<pre>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

Remember to run <code>git submodule update</code> to get the latest version referenced by the project.

h3. TODO

* The alias module shouldn't change behaviour $t() should be the same as turing()
* The enumeration methods should be easy to use through changes, i.e.: turing([1, 2, 3]).each, turing([1, 2, 3]).map, turing('p').each, etc.  Some logic will have to determine if DOM selectors or arrays/objects are being iterated over
* Add benchmarks to Turing Test
* Update benchmarks to use Turing Test
* Remove Riot
